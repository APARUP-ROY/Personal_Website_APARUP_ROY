# Aparup Roy - Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website repository! This site showcases my work, achievements, and interests.

## Design Choices

### Aesthetics
- **Profile Section:** The profile section features a large circular image on the left, with my name and subtitle on the right. This layout is designed to present my information clearly and attractively.
- **Typography and Colors:** A clean sans-serif font and contrasting color scheme are used to ensure readability and a modern look.

### Layout
- **Header and Navigation:** The header includes a welcoming message, and the navigation bar provides links to key sections: Home, Achievements, and Projects.
- **Profile Section:** The profile image is displayed prominently on the left, with my name and subtitle to the right. The "About Me" section below the image offers more details about me.
- **Footer:** A fixed footer keeps the copyright information visible at the bottom of the page.
